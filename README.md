# TinyLlama_color
This is a project made in collaboration with intel's Unnati program.

In this project, we are making advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools accessible on everyday laptops by using a compact language model called TinyLlama which is the smallest of all llms and thus resource efficient and inferencing it with Intel® OpenVINO™. Our goal is to enable powerful AI capabilities without needing expensive hardware like high-end graphics cards. We are training TinyLlama with a detailed dataset of color descriptions so it can understand and generate rich information about different colors. Users simply type a color name or color code into their laptop, and TinyLlama processes this input to produce a detailed, easy-to-read description of the color, which is then displayed on the screen. This makes advanced AI technology more affordable and available to everyone.
